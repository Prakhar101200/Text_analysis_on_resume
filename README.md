#Resume Text Analysis Project


Overview

This project aims to analyze resume text data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project involves cleaning the resume text, exploring the most common words, creating word clouds, and analyzing specific categories such as "Data Science."

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named Resume_Data.csv. It contains various columns including "Category" and "Resume" which stores the raw resume text.

Setup

Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Python script resume_analysis.py to perform the analysis.

Usage
The main usage of this model is to sort the list of resume's according to the company's requirements. It is mainly used by the HR departments to sort the resumes's that perfectly fits to the required standards.

The script Text_Analysis_Resume.ipynb performs the following tasks:

.Loads the resume data from the CSV file using pandas.

.Cleans the resume text by removing hyperlinks, special characters, and non-ASCII characters.

.Tokenizes and lemmatizes the cleaned text.

.Generates frequency distribution plots and word clouds.

.Analyzes specific categories such as "Data Science."

.Modify the script as needed to adapt it to different datasets or analysis requirements.

File Structure

Text_Analysis_Resume.ipynb: Python script containing the main analysis logic.

README.md: Documentation file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
requirements.txt: Text file listing the required Python libraries and their versions.

Results

The analysis provides insights into the most common words and themes present in the resume text data.
Specific analyses can be performed for different categories such as "Data Science."

Hardships Faced

At first, we faced an issue while importing the dataset as, our system was showing error for not being able to decode the file by utf-8 encoder. Therefore, after searching a bit over internet, we found the solution to use different encoder. But, that encoder was not that efficient and was not being able to clean all special character after we created the function. Therefore, we then had to give more syntaxes to  clean more deeply.

#Personal Reflection

Persistence and Learning: Despite the challenges, the project provided an opportunity to learn and grow as a coder. The perseverance to overcome obstacles ultimately led to successful results.

Room for Improvement: Acknowledging that there is always room for improvement, future iterations of the project can focus on refining the code and exploring additional techniques for further enhancing accuracy.

Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the numerous sources available over the internet that helped me throughout this project hardships.

Along with this, I would like to acknowledge "Miss Suchisita Mondal" for teaching me this concept in the class.

I would also like to appreciate 'Eduonix' for creating this Data Science Certification Module that enabled me to explore the world of Data Science and make myself more knowledgable in the concepts. .Lastly, I would like to appreciate myself for not giving up and fighting all obstacles on daily basis, whether its in coding or any other theoritical concepts or in life.

This project was inspired by the need to analyze resume text data using NLP techniques.

Thanks to the Python community for developing and maintaining the libraries used in this project.

Thank you!
